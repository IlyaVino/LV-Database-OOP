-----------------------
Database workflow
	Open connection
	Load Form
		Determine which table you want to load
		Find VI that corresponds to table
		Load VI Ref
			Scan VI for fields
			Determine which field corresponds to which column
			Determine field type
				Ring (FK)
					Populate ring
						Query FK info from database
						Query child table for pk column and display column
						Update ring ctrl reference
					Get and set active entry
				String
					Get and set active entry
				Numeric
					Get and set active entry
	Combine data with form
	Load data to database
	Close connection
	
---------------------------
New structure:
DB class (virtual)
	Methods: all methods required to access database
	Children:
	-SQLite
	-OBDC
		-MS Access
	
Form class interfaces DB class methods
	Properties
	-DB reference (DVR?)
	-Fields
		
Table class interfaces DB class methods
	Properties
	-DB reference (DVR?)
	-Columns
	
Column class interfaces DB class methods
	Properties
	-DB reference (DVR?)
	-Info cluster
	-FK
	-Check
	
	
Form class
	Array of fields
	Associated Query for the field
	
Fields class
	Props: Table, column, ctrl refnum, database object (?) or column  object (?)
	Methods: get/set props, check refnum class, get/set value specific to database/column, get/set display value
	Text - no query
		Props: 
		Methods: check refnum class
	Numeric - check constraint query
		Props: check
		Methods: check refnum class, verify constraints
	Ring - custom query allowed (this is the most complex)
		Props: FK, query
		Methods: check refnum class, set display value, 
		
Table will be built in the back panel

Form.lvclass
	Member data
		Messaging Queues
		VI refnum
		Form builder.lvclass
	Methods
		Calling VI:
			Open Form
			Close Form
			Get Form Data
			Set Form Data
Form builder.lvclass:
	Member data
		Field Array
		Field name lookup (variant)
		
		
		
Form AF

Form model
Form controller
Form UI
Individual forms

What does a form need to do?
	Programmer:
		Design a UI
		Add properties to UI elements (fields)
	User:
		Subpanel:
			Add row to DB 
			Modify existing row (?)
			Call a prompt
		Window:
			Close currently opened forms
			Close all forms
			Modify exisitng row (?)
			Add row to DB from form
		Both:
			Change information
			Open new forms	
	Form (programattically):
		Run form
		Add row to DB based on form
		Modify DB row
		Call a prompt
		Close form
		Close all forms
		Select a form
		
OO/AF architecture
*Form nonAF Wrapper
	*Form Manager actor
		*Form Model actor
			*Form Ctrl actor
			*Form UI actor (abstract)
				*User created form UIs (Actors)
				
				
todo:
clean up column class/interfaces
	-base column interface
		-normal column
			-pk decorator (what does a decorator need? -autoincrement? -unique?)
			-text
			-numeric
		-field
write table constructor
	-database
	-table name
		-choose column class based on column type
		-decorate column with pk designation (is this needed?)
