Bugs:

-When field is registered under wrong name, no error is given and a confusing error is given down the line
-When adding new rows, the PK selector value is updated, but not the list of allowed values
	-Most formal way to fix this is by creating a PK field class, like the FK field class, that tracks registered PK selectors
	-**Chose this one: Less formal way is to lookup if any PK selectro fields are registered in the form.lvclass, and call the update method if they are
-LV Default timestamp causes error in MS Access -- Need to switch to parameterized query to pass null values
